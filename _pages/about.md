Starting off as an idea for a peer-to-peer advising network, STEM for Virginia's main focus has shifted slightly to emphasize pedagogy and public speaking. It is very likely that, at some point in life, every technical profession will have to communicate results and ideas with someone who may not be in the field. Conversely, you might find yourself as the recipient of information you may not be able to understand and decode immediately. 

As such, the group holds weekly, hour-long meetings in which two presenters give talks ~20 minutes long before fielding questions for ~10 minutes. Any further questions can be asked later. Outside of these talks, it's my hopes that members can contribute to the "Teaching" and "Blog Posts" pages to field questions about classes you've taken while providing honest, objective feedback.

Pages
======
***Publications:*** Members are encouraged to post published works here to further expose everyone to different fields. Perhaps it also accompanied a talk that was given!

***Talks:*** Hopefully self-explanatory. Abstracts to talks given in the group will be posted here. Slides and/or lecture notes will likely also be attached.

***Teaching:*** Members in teaching positions (i.e. TA's) will post their thoughts on a course as well as recommendations for it.

***Portfolio:*** Members who create something for their talk or otherwise can post their work here. This can include code, results from an experiment, etc.

***Blog Posts:*** I will figure out how to rename this page. Functionally, honest reviews of STEM courses will be posted here. It's often annoying to only see numeric values without context on sites like CourseForum, so the hope of this page is to alleviate vagueness.
