Hello there! As the page title shows, my name is Mohan. I'm currently a senior at the University of Virginia, and I study chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences. In particular, I find myself at the intersection of math, chemistry, and physics as my main interests lie in the realm of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and Statistical Mechanics (SM). To talk a bit about them, I use QM to work towards a more holistic understanding of transition state theory (TST). In the realm of SM, I use LAMMPS to model a specific inter-atomic potential that governs dynamics at very small length scales. If those words mean nothing to you, I'd be incredibly happy to discuss them further.
