This talk was given for STEM Communication, a group of graduate students who made an exception and were willing to have an undergraduate sit in. My goal was quite lofty as I set out to explore a less rigorous topic in STEM to a group of theoretical physicists and chemists. I think there was a lot of ground to cover in more rigorous scientific fields related to the music including physics (wave mechanics), biology (interpretation of sounds and perhaps even consciousness), and math (measure theory). That said, I believe it went well, and it was a fun experience.
