## Speaker: Mohan Shankar
c/o 2024, Chemistry
## Description:
The hero of today's story will be a matrix. The "villain," a system of linear equations. This talk will introduce the audience to two ways of solving a linear system of equations using matrix-vector notation. We also introduce the concept of an eigenvalue $(\lambda_i )$ and eigenvector $(\vec{v}_{\lambda})$ though we omit any explanation for a systematic way to find them. Equipped with this knowledge, we will present readers a few simplified models to display the real-world utility of these concepts.
