# Student One

***Professor:*** Sergei Egorov

***Textbook:*** *Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach* by Simon and McQuarrie

***Semester Taken:*** Fall, 2023

***Intersting:*** 10/10 

***Workload:*** 4/10 

*10/10 meaning a the most enthralling course ever and ludacris amount of work respectively*

Positives
======
- very interesting/engaging material
- exams provided good opportunity to problem solve and extend understanding of the material due to lack of time constraints from traditional in-class exams
- builds knowledge of the subject in a systematic way rather than introducing equations without any proofs/explanation

Negatives
======
- textbook is not good and can (and should) probably be switched out for a newer one
- the first couple weeks are unnecessarily confusing due to lack of contextualization on the subject (felt like I was just seeing random Greek letters and being expected to understand what they mean without being told what they mean) —> this kind of goes away naturally as you get exposure to the material
- math may be too difficult given the scant pre-reqs (I disagree but I know it’s a common complaint)

Possible Improvements
======

- new textbook (as mentioned above)
- teaching some things that were not explored in class but showed up on exams (Dirac notation for example)
- giving context in the first few lectures because it’s a very unfamiliar subject for most students who take it

Summary
======
An overall very informative class that gets a bad reputation from students that may not have the time or will to put in the necessary effort.
